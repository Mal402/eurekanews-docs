## Reader Guide

### Getting Started as a Reader

Welcome to Eureka News! We're your source for Abstract blockchain news, analysis, and guides.

**What is Eureka News?**
Eureka News exists to solve a critical problem: Abstract projects have amazing technology and communities, but they're trapped in algorithmic echo chambers (Discord, Twitter, Telegram) that don't integrate into the internet's knowledge graph. 

We move information from these siloed platforms onto our indexed website, giving Abstract projects a permanent place in the internet—not just its social feeds. This means:

- **Search engines** (Google, Bing, etc.) can find and index your content
- **AI systems** (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.) can reference Abstract projects when people ask questions
- **People researching cryptocurrency** can discover Abstract projects through natural search
- **Content persists** beyond the 24-hour lifecycle of social media posts
- **Web syndication** via RSS feeds distributes content across aggregators

Unlike Discord or Twitter, all content here is indexed and searchable—making Abstract projects discoverable to the 99% of people who aren't already in crypto Twitter.

**No Account Required**

   - Click **"+ New Breaking News"** to create a post

2. **Quick Publishing Workflow**
   - Breaking news can be published in under 60 seconds
   - Posts automatically go to website, Telegram, and Discord
   - Twitter share opens automatically for manual posting

#### When to Use Breaking News

**Use breaking news for:**
- ✅ Immediate updates: Price movements, announcements, launches
- ✅ Quick takes: Brief analysis or commentary
- ✅ Curated tweets: Share important tweets with context
- ✅ Time-sensitive info: News that can't wait for a full article

**Don't use breaking news for:**
- ❌ Long-form content (use regular articles instead)
- ❌ In-depth analysis (write a full article)
- ❌ Content that needs extensive editing

### Breaking News Best Practices

#### Content Guidelines

**Length & Format:**
- Aim for 50-300 words
- Use line breaks for readability
- Keep it scannable and concise
- Can include Twitter embeds (just paste the URL)

**Tone:**
- Professional but conversational
- Excited for good news, factual for neutral news
- No clickbait or misleading headlines
- Add context to important announcements

**Sources:**
- Link to official announcements
- Embed official tweets when possible
- Cite sources for price data
- Verify information before publishing

#### Using Twitter Embeds

**Best Practice:**
```markdown
Big news from @AbstractChain:

https://twitter.com/AbstractChain/status/1234567890

This changes everything for DeFi on Abstract!
```

**Why this works:**
- Has context before the tweet
- Uses emojis for attention (sparingly)
- Adds commentary after the embed
- Makes the tweet part of a narrative

#### Image Best Practices

**Good Image Types:**
- Screenshots of important tweets ✅
- Charts and graphs showing data ✅
- Official announcement graphics ✅
- Memes (use sparingly and only when appropriate) 🤔

**Image Quality:**
- Minimum 800px wide
- Not blurry or pixelated
- Properly cropped
- Mobile-friendly (no tiny text)
- Recommended: 1200x630px for best social media display

#### Tag Strategy

**Choose relevant, specific tags:**
- ✅ "Abstract Chain", "Lil Pudgys", "DeFi"
- ❌ "News", "Update", "Announcement" (too generic)

**Use 1-3 tags:**
- 1 tag: Very focused news (e.g., specific NFT collection)
- 2-4 tags: Broader ecosystem news (e.g., "Abstract" + "DeFi" + "Launch")

#### Publishing Workflow

**Before Publishing:**
1. ✅ Verify the information is accurate
2. ✅ Check spelling and grammar
3. ✅ Ensure tags are relevant
4. ✅ Add featured image if available
5. ✅ Review content for clarity

**During Publishing:**
1. Click **"Publish & Share"**
2. Select channels (Telegram/Discord/Twitter)
3. Review the Twitter compose window
4. Make any final edits to the tweet
5. Post to Twitter manually

**After Publishing:**
- Post appears on website immediately
- Telegram and Discord receive instant updates
- Monitor for any corrections needed
- Edit published posts if typos are found (won't re-post to social)

#### Speed vs. Accuracy

**Priority Order:**
1. **Accuracy first**: Never publish unverified information
2. **Speed second**: Breaking news should be timely, but not at the cost of accuracy
3. **Context matters**: Add brief context even in time-sensitive situations

**When to Wait:**
- If information is unconfirmed
- If you need to verify sources
- If the announcement is unclear
- If you're unsure about facts

**When to Publish Fast:**
- Official announcements from verified sources
- Price movements from reliable data sources
- Confirmed launches and updates
- Curated tweets from official accounts

#### Handling Corrections

**If you make a mistake:**
1. Edit the post immediately on the website
2. For Telegram/Discord: Post a correction message
3. If major error: Consider deleting and reposting
4. Learn from the mistake for future posts

**Best Practice:**
- Double-check before publishing
- Have a second pair of eyes for major announcements
- Use draft mode to review before publishing
- Keep a corrections log for learning

#### Mobile Publishing

Breaking news can be published from mobile devices:

**Mobile Workflow:**
1. Open `/admin/breaking-news/new` on your phone
2. Write content using mobile keyboard
3. Paste tweet URLs (they'll auto-embed)
4. Select tags using mobile-friendly checkboxes
5. Upload images from your camera roll
6. Hit Publish - done in 60 seconds!

**Mobile Tips:**

- Bookmark the breaking news page on your phone

#### Examples

**Price Movement:**
