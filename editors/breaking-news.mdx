## When to Use Breaking News

### Use breaking news for:

- ✅ Immediate updates: Price movements, announcements, launches
- ✅ Quick takes: Brief analysis or commentary
- ✅ Curated tweets: Share important tweets with context
- ✅ Time-sensitive info: News that can't wait for a full article

### Don't use breaking news for:

- ❌ Long-form content (use regular articles instead)
- ❌ In-depth analysis (write a full article)
- ❌ Content that needs extensive editing

## Breaking News Best Practices

### Content Guidelines

**Length & Format:**

- Aim for 50-300 words
- Use line breaks for readability
- Keep it scannable and concise
- Can include Twitter embeds (just paste the URL)

**Tone:**

- Professional but conversational
- Excited for good news, factual for neutral news
- No clickbait or misleading headlines
- Add context to important announcements

**Sources:**

- Link to official announcements
- Embed official tweets when possible
- Cite sources for price data
- Verify information before publishing

### Using Twitter Embeds

**Best Practice:**

```markdown
Big news from @AbstractChain:

https://twitter.com/AbstractChain/status/1234567890

This changes everything for DeFi on Abstract!
```

**Why this works:**

- Has context before the tweet
- Uses emojis for attention (sparingly)
- Adds commentary after the embed
- Makes the tweet part of a narrative

### Image Best Practices

**Good Image Types:**

- Screenshots of important tweets ✅
- Charts and graphs showing data ✅
- Official announcement graphics ✅
- Memes (use sparingly and only when appropriate) 🤔

**Image Quality:**

- Minimum 800px wide
- Not blurry or pixelated
- Properly cropped
- Mobile-friendly (no tiny text)
- Recommended: 1200x630px for best social media display

### Tag Strategy

**Choose relevant, specific tags:**

- ✅ "Abstract Chain", "Lil Pudgys", "DeFi"
- ❌ "News", "Update", "Announcement" (too generic)

**Use 2-6 tags:**

- 1 tag: Very focused news (e.g., specific NFT collection)
- 2-4 tags: Broader ecosystem news (e.g., "Abstract" + "DeFi" + "Launch")

## Publishing Workflow

### Before Publishing

1. ✅ Verify the information is accurate
2. ✅ Check spelling and grammar
3. ✅ Ensure tags are relevant
4. ✅ Add featured image if available
5. ✅ Review content for clarity

### During Publishing

1. Click **"Publish & Share"**
2. Select channels (Telegram/Discord/Twitter)
3. Review the Twitter compose window
4. Make any final edits to the tweet
5. Post to Twitter manually

### After Publishing

- Post appears on website immediately
- Telegram and Discord receive instant updates
- Monitor for any corrections needed
- Edit published posts if typos are found (won't re-post to social)

## Speed vs. Accuracy

### Priority Order

1. **Accuracy first**: Never publish unverified information
2. **Speed second**: Breaking news should be timely, but not at the cost of accuracy
3. **Context matters**: Add brief context even in time-sensitive situations

### When to Wait

- If information is unconfirmed
- If you need to verify sources
- If the announcement is unclear
- If you're unsure about facts

### When to Publish Fast

- Official announcements from verified sources
- Price movements from reliable data sources
- Confirmed launches and updates
- Curated tweets from official accounts

## Handling Corrections

### If you make a mistake:

1. Edit the post immediately on the website
2. For Telegram/Discord: Post a correction message
3. If major error: Consider deleting and reposting
4. Learn from the mistake for future posts

### Best Practice

- Double-check before publishing
- Have a second pair of eyes for major announcements
- Use draft mode to review before publishing
- Keep a corrections log for learning
