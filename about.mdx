## What is Eureka News?

Eureka News is a community-led crypto content platform dedicated to **indexing Abstract ecosystem content**. We move information from siloed platforms (Discord, Twitter, Telegram) onto our website where it can be discovered by search engines, referenced by AI systems, and found by people researching cryptocurrency.

**Our Core Mission:** Give Abstract projects a permanent place in the internet's knowledge graph, not just its social feeds. Transform algorithmic echo chambers into indexed knowledge that makes projects discoverable to everyone.

## What We Publish

We publish:

Every article moves Abstract project content from ephemeral social feeds to permanent pages that build a comprehensive resource for the ecosystem.

## Our Impact

Unlike Discord or Twitter, all content here is indexed and searchable—making Abstract projects discoverable to the 99% of people who aren't already in crypto Twitter.

- **Search engines** (Google, Bing, etc.) can find and index your content
- **AI systems** (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.) can reference Abstract projects when people ask questions
- **People researching cryptocurrency** can discover Abstract projects through regular search
- **Content persists** beyond the 24-hour lifecycle of social media posts
- **Web syndication** via RSS feeds distributes content across aggregators

## Content Organization

### Tag System

Tags create content hubs that help readers understand project relationships in the Abstract ecosystem. Each tag can represent:

- **Collections**: NFT collections (e.g., "Lil Pudgys", "Web3 Playboys")
- **Tokens**: Cryptocurrencies (e.g., "Bigcoin", "Eureka")
