- Bullet point
- Another bullet

1. Numbered list

[Link text](https://example.com)
```

### Code Blocks

```markdown
Inline `code` with backticks
```

For code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
// Code block with syntax highlighting
function example() {
  return "Hello, World!";
}
```

### Images
