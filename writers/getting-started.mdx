## Your Role as a Writer

**You're building a comprehensive resource for Abstract projects.** Every article you write moves content from siloed platforms (Discord, Twitter, Telegram) onto permanent pages that:

- Can be discovered by people searching for information
- Persist beyond the 24-hour lifecycle of social media posts
- Get syndicated across the web via RSS feeds
- Build a lasting archive of Abstract ecosystem knowledge

### What You Can Do

- Create and edit your own articles
- Submit articles for editorial review
- Request access to new tags/topics
- View your published articles and stats
- Manage your profile
- **Contribute to Abstract ecosystem knowledge** - Your content becomes a permanent resource

### What You Cannot Do

- Publish articles directly (must go through review)
- Edit articles after they're published
- Use tags you haven't been assigned
- Access other writers' drafts

## Article States

Articles go through these states:

1. **Draft**: Your work-in-progress article (you can edit freely)
2. **Submitted**: Article submitted for review (read-only for you)
3. **In Review**: Editor is reviewing your article
4. **Needs Revision**: Editor requested changes (you can edit again and resubmit)
5. **Published**: Article is live on the website (read-only)
6. **Rejected**: Article was rejected (e.g. against content policy)

<Note>
  Published articles cannot be edited or unpublished by writers. Contact an editor if you need changes.
