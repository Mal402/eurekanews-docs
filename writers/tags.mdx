## Understanding Tags

Tags are topics you can write about. Examples:
- **Abstract Chain**: General Abstract blockchain content
- **DeFi**: Decentralized finance protocols
- **NFTs**: Non-fungible tokens and collections
- **Lil Pudgys**: Specific NFT collection
- **Trading**: Market analysis and trading content

**Tags Build Content Hubs:** Each tag creates a content hub. When you write about a tagged project, you're contributing to a comprehensive resource that helps readers understand that project's place in the Abstract ecosystem.

## Tag Permissions

**As a writer, you can only use tags you've been assigned.**

- When creating an article, you'll see all available tags
- Tags you can use are **enabled** (clickable)
- Tags you can't use are **disabled** (grayed out with a lock icon)

## Requesting Tag Access

### Request from Dashboard

1. Go to `/admin/dashboard` or `/admin/tag-communities/`
2. Browse available tags
3. Click "Request Access" on tags you want to write about
4. Staff will review your request

### After Requesting

- Your request is sent to staff
- You'll be notified when your request is approved or rejected
- Approved tags immediately become available for use

## Tag Best Practices

- **Choose 2-6 relevant tags** per article
- Don't over-tag (more tags ≠ better)
- Use specific tags when possible
- You can select up to 10 tags, use only when appropriate
- Request tags proactively if you plan to write about a topic regularly
- **Think about organization** - Tags create content hubs that help readers find related information

<Tip>
Request tags proactively if you plan to write about a topic regularly. This ensures you have access when you need it.
