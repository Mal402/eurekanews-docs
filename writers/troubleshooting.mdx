## Common Issues

### "You don't have permission to use this tag"

**Solution**: Request access to the tag from your profile or the article editor
- Tags must be assigned by an editor before you can use them

**Solution**: Check that all required fields are filled:
- Title
- Slug
- Excerpt
- Content
- Tags (at least one)

### "Article is read-only"

**Reason**: Article is submitted, in review, or published

**Solution**:

- If published: Contact an editor for changes

### "Can't find the tag I need"

**Solution**:
- Request the tag to be created (contact an editor)
- Or use the closest available tag
- Check if the tag exists under a different name
