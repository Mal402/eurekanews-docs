## Writing Quality Content

### Research First

- Verify facts and sources
- Link to official announcements
- Cite data and statistics
- Include multiple perspectives when appropriate
- **Source from siloed platforms** - Transform Discord announcements, Twitter threads, and Telegram updates into comprehensive, well-structured articles

### Write Clearly

- Use clear, concise language
- Break up long paragraphs
- Use headings to organize content
- Include examples and explanations
- **Think beyond social media** - Write comprehensive, well-structured content that serves readers first

### Engage Readers

- Start with a compelling hook
- Use storytelling when appropriate
- Include visuals (images, charts)
- End with a clear conclusion or call-to-action

## SEO Best Practices

### Why This Matters

Quality, well-structured content naturally performs better. Our platform is built to help your articles:
- Get indexed by search engines quickly
- Be referenced by AI systems when people ask about Abstract projects
- Build long-term value as a persistent resource
- Reach wider audiences through RSS feed syndication

### Title Optimization

- Include relevant keywords naturally
- Keep titles under 60 characters
- Make titles compelling and clear
- Write titles that accurately describe your content

### Meta Descriptions

- Write unique descriptions for each article
- Keep under 160 characters
- Make it compelling and accurate
- Summarize what readers will learn from your article

### Content Structure

- Use H2 and H3 headings to organize content
- Include keywords in headings naturally
- Write descriptive alt text for images
- Use internal links to other Eureka News articles
- H1 comes from the Title you input, do not use it in the body (best practices)
- **Build topic authority** - Each article contributes to comprehensive coverage of Abstract ecosystem topics

## Image Guidelines

### Featured Images

- Size: 1200x630px (optimal for social media)
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Quality: High resolution, not pixelated
- Content: Relevant to your article topic

### In-Article Images

- Use images to break up text
- Include captions when helpful
- Optimize file sizes (use compressed images)
- Credit sources when required

## Tag Selection

### Choose Wisely

- Select 2-6 most relevant tags
- Use specific tags over generic ones
- Consider your target audience
- Don't tag spam (more tags ≠ better)

### Examples

- ✅ Good: "Abstract Chain" + "DeFi" + "Tutorials" + "Aborean"
- ❌ Bad: "News" + "Update" + "Market Overview" (too generic)
