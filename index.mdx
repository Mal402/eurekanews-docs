## Welcome to Eureka News

Eureka News is a community-led crypto content platform dedicated to **indexing Abstract ecosystem content**. We move information from siloed platforms (Discord, Twitter, Telegram) onto our website where it can be discovered by search engines, referenced by AI systems, and found by people researching cryptocurrency.

## Our Mission

**Give Abstract projects a permanent place in the internet's knowledge graph, not just its social feeds.**

Unlike Discord or Twitter, all content here is indexed and searchable—making Abstract projects discoverable to the 99% of people who aren't already in crypto Twitter.

### What We Do

- **Index content** from siloed platforms (Discord, Twitter, Telegram) onto permanent web pages
- **Enable discovery** through search engines (Google, Bing, etc.)
- **Support AI systems** (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.) that reference Abstract projects
- **Build persistent resources** that outlast the 24-hour lifecycle of social media posts
- **Syndicate content** via RSS feeds across aggregators

## Content Types

We publish:

- **News articles**: Breaking news, announcements, updates
- **Analysis**: In-depth market analysis, project reviews  
- **Guides**: Tutorials, how-tos, educational content
- **Breaking News**: Time-sensitive updates and quick takes published in real-time

Every article moves Abstract project content from ephemeral social feeds to permanent pages that build a comprehensive resource for the ecosystem.
