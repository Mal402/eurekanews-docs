## Getting Started as a Reader

Welcome to Eureka News! We're your source for Abstract blockchain news, analysis, and guides.

### What is Eureka News?

Eureka News exists to solve a critical problem: Abstract projects have amazing technology and communities, but they're trapped in algorithmic echo chambers (Discord, Twitter, Telegram) that don't integrate into the internet's knowledge graph.

We move information from these siloed platforms onto our indexed website, giving Abstract projects a permanent place in the internet—not just its social feeds. This means:

- **Search engines** (Google, Bing, etc.) can find and index your content
- **AI systems** (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.) can reference Abstract projects when people ask questions
- **People researching cryptocurrency** can discover Abstract projects through natural search
- **Content persists** beyond the 24-hour lifecycle of social media posts
- **Web syndication** via RSS feeds distributes content across aggregators

Unlike Discord or Twitter, all content here is indexed and searchable—making Abstract projects discoverable to the 99% of people who aren't already in crypto Twitter.
