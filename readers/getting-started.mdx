## Welcome to Eureka News

Welcome to Eureka News! We're your source for Abstract blockchain news, analysis, and guides.

### What is Eureka News?

Eureka News is an indexed website that publishes Abstract ecosystem content. We move information from social platforms (Discord, Twitter, Telegram) onto permanent web pages that are searchable and discoverable.

Unlike social media posts that disappear in feeds, our content is:

- **Searchable** - Findable through Google, Bing, and other search engines
- **AI-referenced** - Referenced by ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other AI systems
- **Persistent** - Content stays available beyond the 24-hour social media lifecycle
- **Syndicated** - Distributed via RSS feeds across aggregators

All content here is indexed and searchable, making Abstract projects discoverable through search engines and AI systems.

### No Account Required

- You can read all content without signing in
- Engagement (claps, reactions) is tracked via IP address
- User accounts will be available in the future for enhanced features
